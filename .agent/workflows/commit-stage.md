**DO NOT USE `git add -a`**

Use the `git` command line to:
1. Analyze the files on the git stage with `git diff --cached`
2. Create a commit using a commit message generated by "Call /commit-message" (or read @.agents/commands/commit-message.md)
  - the generated commit message should be in `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt`
3. Delete `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt` if it exists
4. Push the commit to the remote with `git push origin HEAD`
5. Create a PR with `git-create-pr` with a meaningful title `-t` and detailed and informative description `-d`

**NOTE**: before running `git-create-pr`, make sure that you have run `source ~/.windsurfrc` first.
Also, if you can't find `git-create-pr` look for it at `~/bin/git-create-pr`
