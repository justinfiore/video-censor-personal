**DO NOT USE `git add -a`**

Use the `git` command line to:
1. Add all newly-created files (that should be committed) to the stage individually
2. Add all updated files to the stage with `git add -u`
3. Create a commit using a commit message generated by "Call /commit-message" (or read @.agents/commands/commit-message.md)
  - the generated commit message should be in `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt`
4. Delete `COMMIT_MESSAGE.txt` if it exists
5. Push the commit to the remote with `git push origin HEAD`
