description: Refactor the commit history to make a clean branch

The code is working as it is. However, the branch is a bit messy in terms of commit messages, clean coherent logical commits, etc.

I want you to create a new branch from the current branch (just add the `-clean` suffix).

Then create a cleaner commit history where each commit is cohesive and performs a small logical part of the overall branch.
Each commit message should be clear and descriptive.

Make sure to push the new branch to the remote with `git push origin HEAD`
